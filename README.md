# Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

# Example

```python
X = np.random.randn(10000, 30)

model = deann.DEANN(k=20, m=30, metric="euclidean", bandwidth=None, exact=True, gpu_id=None)
model.fit(X) # Fit the kernel density estimator
log_density = model.log_density(X) # Log density
percentile = model.percentile(X) # Percentile
```
- `k`: Number of the nearest data points. A large `k` improves the accuracy at expense of computation time.
- `m`: Number of randomly sampled data points. A large `m` improves the accuracy at expense of computation time.
- `metric`: Distance metrics. Set `euclidean` or `cosine`.
- `bandwidth`: Bandwidth of the kernel function. Set `bandwidth=None` will set the bandwidth based on a common hueristics. See the code for detail.
- `exact`: `exact=False` will use approximated nearest neighbor algorithms.
- `gpu_id`: ID of the GPU device. If `gpu_id=None`, CPUs will be used.
